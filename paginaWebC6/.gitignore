# Creating GIT Ignore file:
# $touch .gitignore

# or
# $vi .gitignore

# 	 Ex.: *.json (* mean that all files .json will be ignored)
# 	 EX.: 
# Inside this folder, add the files that will be ignored

# Retunrning to MAIN file:
# $:wq 

# Also you can use to add inside .gitignore:
# $echo fileName >> .gitignore

# *
# Which files to ignore?
# We recommend ignoring files of types like :
# • Log files
# •  Files that contain passwords, credentials or information
#   confidential
# •  System and temporary files
# •  Generated files such as test executables
# • Compiled outputs (executables, etc.)
# • Personal archives
# *
# Examples of patterns:
# => testArch # ignore the file ( or directory ) testarch
# => *.log # ignore all files with .log extension
# => arq* # ignore all files starting with arq
# => ?rq # ignore all files regardless of the first character, but which have rq in the sequence
# => testDir/ # ignore Test dir and its files
# => **/testDir # ignores all directories named test dir
# => !output.log # DO NOT ignore the output.log file
